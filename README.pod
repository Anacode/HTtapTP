=head1 NAME

HTtapTP - tools supported Test Anything Protocol over HTTP


=head1 DESCRIPTION

This tool arose from

=over 4

=item * some ad-hoc tests which loaded with JavaScript into an HTML table

=item * the need to write some more tests with a similar interface

=item * a Perl-world preference for TAP

=back

=head2 The plan

=over 4

=item * enumerate TAP-producing URLs (not implemented here)

There is an implementation in the team-internal C<webvm.git>, which
could benefit from liberation.

It lists other backend servers from a nearby configuration file , then
lists CGI scripts in a path relative to the C<$DOCUMENT_ROOT> and
assumes these are present everywhere.  Then it draws a table of
(server, TAP path) cells.

See also L</Finding tests>.

=item * generate TAP from CGI scripts

While continuing to allow them to run directly under F<prove(1)>, and
then noting that this ability can easily bit-rot because the test can
be less convenient to run.

=item * load and parse the TAP in the web browser

=item * display neat green / red output

=item * report the summary back to somewhere (not implemented)

=item * extend L<prove(1)> to let it fetch HTtapTP (not implemented)

For now, I use this

 #! /bin/sh
 exec prove -e 'curl -s' "$@"

=back

=head1 CAVEATS

=over 4

=item * Some parts of the TAP spec are not supported.

TODO tests look like failures.

=item * The global $SIG{__DIE__} shows up internal stuff in some code.

https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=75390

L<Test::More/plan> C<skip_all>

=item * API is missing, to unify @ARGV and CGI params.

Best to not use either?

=item * No standard mechanism to enumerate tests remotely.

The first application of this has CGI to enumerate tests and
webservers, assume the set of tests is the same elsewhere, and draw a
2D grid.  It is internal.

=item * Various issues with CORS.

=head1 FUTURE PLANS

=head2 Finding tests

There is a space here for some enumeration protocol, on which to
standardise within this context.

=over 4

=item * allow remote TAP URL listing

=item * allow detection of L<Test::More/subtest> parts

They could be called independently to increase responsiveness.

=item * should not rely on HTTP directory listing

This is frequently disabled for CGI script directories.

=back

=head2 Reporting outcomes

Currently, results are displayed on screen but otherwise ephemeral.

It would be good to collect them somewhere,
e.g. L<Tapper::Reports::Receiver>, L<TAP::Harness::Archive>.

C<POST>ing back to the originating enumeration URL might make sense.
